#summary How to contribute to this project

Here you will find information that you'll need to be able to contribute to this project. Be sure to read the whole thing before sending us a contribution, including the small print at the end.

= Before you contribute =

Before you start working on a larger contribution you should get in touch with us first through the mailing list so we can help out and possibly guide you; coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

= Getting the code =

To get a read-only version of the code use:

{{{svn checkout http://sitemap-generators.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sitemap-generators}}}

If you're a member of the project you can get a writable version over HTTPS:

{{{svn checkout https://sitemap-generators.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sitemap-generators --username <your username>}}}

This requires your [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings generated googlecode.com password].

= Submitting code =

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. 

= The small print =

Before we can use your code you have to sign the [http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html Google Individual Contributor License Agreement], which you can do online. This is mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other things, for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to do this until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you will have to do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than the one above, the [http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement].
